\section{CHANGES IN boral VERSION 1.6}{
This list below is written in terms of what is deemed to be most important to least important changes =P 

  \itemize{
     \item As some consultation with new and fellow co-maintainer Wade Blanchard, we have decided that from version 1.6 onwards, functions to calculate information criteria will not longer be updated. This is for two reasons: 1) As more modifications and options are added to boral, calculation of information criteria for all of these modifications becomes too tedious and \emph{ad-hoc} that we believe it is not worth it implementing this; 2) we hope that future modifications (along with the currently available SSVS) will offer more viable alternatives to the use of information criteria (if one's goal is indeed to perform variable selection).

     \item Thanks to Michael Bedward and Johannes Radinger for picking up a few bugs in the boral associated with the naming or row effects and grepping of objects respectively!
